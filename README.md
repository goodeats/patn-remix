# My personal website

Hello world!

## About

### Created with [Remix Run Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/tree/main)

The Remix Run concept resonates with me as an outstanding "project generator".
I'm a firm believer in the value of using time and energy wisely. With this in
mind, I took advantage of the Epic Stack's opinionated best-practices, enabling
me to bypass the exhausting and repetitive process of setting up standard
features such as frontend, backend, database, auth, UI, deployment, testing, and
more.

The result is a full-bodied app brought to life with a single command line,
which I believe encapsulates the potential for even more dynamic and
full-featured concept building. This aids in bringing products and ideas to
market as swiftly, reliably, and scalable as possible.

### Project Goals

This project started as a simple idea - to build a digital portfolio that
showcases my skills and experiences as a web developer. With a background in
creating full-stack apps for startups in sectors ranging from computer vision
and chat bots to health tech and e-commerce, I felt the need to establish a
platform where I could share my work.

While not all my professional details can be shared here, I hope this site
provides a glimpse into my capabilities through the various links, blog posts,
and other elements that make up this portfolio.
